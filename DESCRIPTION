Description: Provides a very simple syntax for the user to specify what kind of plot(s) they want without having to remember complicated 'ggplot2' syntax. The 'ChartQL' library uses 'ggplot2' and manages all the syntax complexities internally. As an example, to generate a bar chart of company sales faceted by product category further faceted by season of the year, we simply write: "CHART bar X category, season Y sales".
