Description: ChartQL uses a very simple syntax for the user to specify what kind of
    plot(s) they want to generate without having to remember complicated syntax. The ChartQL
    library uses ggplot2 and manages all the syntax complexities internally. As an example,
    to generate a bar chart of company sales faceted by product category further faceted
    by season of the year, we simply write:
    "CHART bar X category, season Y sales"
